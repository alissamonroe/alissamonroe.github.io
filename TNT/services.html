					<p>TNT offers a variety of lawn care services. We recognize that your lawn is unique, which is why we tailor our mowing schedule to the needs of your grass. We take into consideration the type of grass and the amount of precipitation your lawn has received in order to determine when your lawn will need to be cut, providing you with a better looking and healthier lawn. We only use walk-behind mowers in order to give your grass a better cut. <br><br>
					TNT also offers aeration services. Aeration is  an important part of having a healthy lawn. We recommend doing it at least once a year- either in the spring or the fall. Aeration removes soil plugs from your lawn which allows the compacted soil to expand into the empty spaces as your lawn grows. Aeration allows vital nutrients, water, fertilizer, and pesticides to move easily into your soil; lets grass roots extend into the soil to extract nutrients; and promotes a healthy population of microorganisms that break down thatch. If left alone, thatch can block water and nutrients from reaching your lawn, leaving it vulnerable to disease. <a href="#service7">See TNT's steps to a beautiful lawn.</a></p>

					<p>Kill and repel pesky mosquitos this summer with our all-natural mosquito spray. We use a liquid based garlic blend in order to provide you with a chemical free and poison free solution to your insect problems. Spraying garlic to keep insects away isn’t something new, farmers and gardeners have been doing it for several generations. <br><br>
					Because mosquitos are soft bodied insects, garlic is toxic to them in increased concentrations, while it doesn't  harm humans. While tradition chemical pesticides kill more than just mosquitos, our blend doesn’t harm bees or butterflies and is completely safe for children, as well as birds, cats, dogs, fish, and other pets. Everything from your  lawn to your outdoor furniture can be treated with this special blend. Our garlic blend will keep mosquitos away for as long as they can detect the odor. To humans, the spray becomes scentless within minutes, but mosquitos can detect the odor up to 10,000 times better than humans. One application provides protection for at least three weeks. Our blend is also successful in killing and repelling ticks, fleas, fire ants, and gnats. <br><br>
					TNT's three pronged attack: <br>
					1) Kill adult mosquitos by exposing them to garlic<br>
					2) Repel mosquitos by spraying your property with our garlic blend<br>
					3) Suffocate mosquito larvae in standing water<br></p>

					<p><i>Every neighborhood has one, but few know how they do it. Grass that redefines what green is. Lush, thick, almost soft…. The Perfect Lawn.  This year is your year, and here is our game plan!</i> <br><br>

					<u><b>Fertilization and Herbicide (Five-Step Process)</u></b><br><br>

					<b>Step 1: Fertilization and Herbicide (April 15- May 1)</b><br><br>

					Stop pesky weeds and nurture your lawn from the start with a dose of pre-emergent herbicide and fertilizer.  Pre-emergent herbicide is a chemical used to prevent weed growth before seeds germinate. This is performed by inhibiting the root growth of the weed. It is important to apply pre-emergent herbicide before weeds germinate, or start to grow. Germination for most seeds occurs when the soil reaches 52 degrees Fahrenheit (typically between April 15 and May 1). We use a powerful but safe herbicide called Dithiopyr, also known as Dimension. Studies conducted by Purdue showed that Dimension has a 96% success rate in controlling over 45 different kinds of weeds (the next best product controls only 30 species with an 84% success rate). For the season's first fertilizer application, we use a 19-0-6 fertilizer which gives your lawn exactly what it needs to shoot up and start the season out strong.<br><br>
 

					<b>Step 1.5: (Optional) Aeration and Seeding (mid-April to mid-May)</b><br><br>

					TNT recommends aerating your lawn at least once a year. If your lawn wasn't aerated in the fall, mid-April to mid-May is an excellent time to do it. Often lawns have a buildup of thatch under the surface of grass. Thatch acts as a natural weed barrier and fertilizer due to its high nitrogen content. However, in excess, it can trap in moisture and prevent sunlight from reaching your grass. Core aeration withdraws long tubes of thatch from your lawn which opens passageways for water, air, fertilizer, seed, and other vital nutrients. Unlike dethatching, core aeration is very gentle on root systems which leads to additional health and vegetation. Once your lawn has been aerated, it is the perfect time to overseed and touch up parts of your lawn that are not as thick. To promote fast and long lasting results we use an assortment of customized grass mixtures for shady or sunny areas.<br><br>

					<b>Step 2: Weed and Feed (mid-June)	</b>	<br><br>				

					It’s time for a second dosage of fertilizer this time with a post-emergent herbicide. Post-emergent herbicide targets weeds after they have sprouted. We use a combination of Dicamba and Penoxsulam which specializes in killing broadleaf weeds before and after they sprout. This will help eliminate any weeds that germinate later in the season such as dandelions.<br><br>

					<b>Step 3: Repeat step 2 (late July)</b><br><br>

					Step 2 is repeated to kill late germinating broadleaf weeds. Due to the nature of a broadleaf fertilizer, we recommend including this double treatment to make sure ALL broadleaf weeds are killed.<br><br>

					<b>Step 4: Fertilizer (early-September)</b><br><br>

					For your early fall application, we use a 28-3-10 composition that features a unique blend of iron to increase your lawn's color and a 50% Uflexx coating for both short and long-term nitrogen absorption. Uflexx coats the fertilizer and prevents a loss of nitrogen. It also acts as a stabilizer that allows the grass to absorb the nitrogen more efficiently. Click here to learn more about Uflexx fertilizer coating.<br><br>

​
					<b>Step 4.5: (Optional) Aeration (mid-September to mid-October)</b><br><br>

					If your lawn wasn't aerated in the spring, mid-September to mid-October is a great time to do it. It is important that after your lawn is aerated, it is mowed 2-3 times before the end of the season.<br><br>
 

					<b>Step 5: Fertilization and Herbicide (mid-October to early-November)</b><br><br>

					Fall is the perfect time to knock out annual and perennial weeds such as dandelions and clovers. Winter annuals typically germinate in the early fall, these include henbit, chickweed, annual bluegrass, and burweed. During the fall, weeds prepare for the winter by shifting food storages from their leaves to their roots. A pre-emergent herbicide will kill the weed at the source, eliminating them for next spring! We use the same product as in Step 1 for the final treatment of your lawn. If however, your lawn already has perennial and annual weeds, we will use a post-emergent, like in Step 3.</p>
