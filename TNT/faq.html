					<h5>Q: I am going out of town for a couple weeks, will TNT mow my lawn just while I am gone?</h5>
					<p>A: Yes, TNT offers short-term lawn care services. Whether you are gone for a few days or a few months, let the professionals at TNT take care of your lawn.</p>
					<h5>Q: How short will you cut my grass?</h5>
					<p>A: We recommend mowing grass at 3.5”. Such height promotes healthy root growth, creates a greater tolerance to infrequent watering, and decreases stress from droughts. The height of your grass relates to the depth of the grass' roots. Having a longer blade will allow the root to penetrate deep into the soil, absorbing more nutrients and water. In addition, a longer blade creates shade for the base of the plant. If however, you wish to have your lawn mowed at a different height, please let us know and we will accommodate your request. </p>
					<h5>Q: How often will you mow my lawn?</h5>
					<p>A: There are many factors that impact the growth rate of grass. Most lawn care companies ignore these ecosystemic attributes and use a periodic 7-day schedule for mowing. At TNT Services, we take a different approach; every time we come to your house we will observe the length of the grass which we use to determine future scheduling. This is important because it allows us to mow only a third of the blade off, which optimizes the break down of mulched grass and its absorption into the soil.</p>
					<h5>Q: Will TNT trim my lawn as well?</h5>
					<p>A: With every lawn mow, we will trim around the edges of your house and any areas that our lawn mowers are unable to reach. We recommend trimming these areas shorter in the spring and higher the rest the year for a crisp and sharp look to the lawn. </p>
					<h5>Q: Does TNT use riding mowers?</h5>
					<p>A: Unlike other lawn care providers, TNT Services does not use riding lawn mowers. We find that they are too heavy and clumsy when dealing with residential properties. In contrast, we use WAW (wide area walk-behind) lawn mowers. The deck size on our biggest lawn mower is 48”. Some of our clients prefer the use of a smaller lawn mower. This is typically due to personal preference for a specific width. If you have a preference and wish for us to use our smaller 21” lawn mowers, this can be requested. (NOTE: due to the extra time that it may take, there may be an adjustment in price and/or alteration in capacity to service). </p>
					<h5>Q: Does the use of walk-behind mowers cause scalping?</h5>
					<p>A: In very few cases, a lawn's terrain can be uneven. This can cause one of our wheels to sink into the indentation and create an uneven cut called scalping. We use specific techniques to prevent scalping, however, despite our efforts it still happens. We ask that if you notice scalping on your property, please call us at once! We will treat the area with supplemented iron or grass seed depending on the severity.</p>
					<h5>Q: I want my lawn bagged, will TNT accommodate this?</h5>
					<p>A: We stand firmly behind our practice of mulching instead of bagging. Bagging grass can have severe repercussions on your lawn's turf. Research has shown that 46%-59% of your lawn's yearly intake of nitrogen can come from mulching. In addition, mulching grass helps fortify the thatch layer that lies under the grass leaf and extends into the root system. This thatch layer is key to locking in moisture and protecting the grass from sun and insects. To maximize the benefits of mulching, only a third of the blade should be cut off per mow-- we tailor our schedules to meet this requirement. However, if you feel strongly about having us mulch your yard and instead want us to bag it, we will be happy to accommodate you. (NOTE: due to the extra time that it may take, there may be an adjustment in price and/or alteration in capacity to service).</p>
					<h5>Q: Will you mow my grass if it is wet?</h5>
					<p>A: Morning dew or the day after a heavy rain--mowing damp or wet grass is inevitable. We sharpen our blades every other day to provide a great cut in all weather conditions. When mowing wet grass, we overlap our lines and operate at a slower pace in order to allow the blade to thoroughly mulch the clippings and prevent clumping. Please know that we may have to mow your lawn when it is wet. However, we will not mow when the ground is over saturated. We are required to abide by these practices in order to maintain our schedules and control your grass' length. If you wish to have us skip mowing your lawn on days when grass is wet, please let us know and we will service your lawn at a later time.</p>
					<h5>Q: When should my lawn be aerated?</h5>
					<p>A: We recommend aeration at least once a year, either in the spring or early fall.</p>

			<h4 class="greentitle">Staining</h4>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="easyreader">
					<h5>Q: Will my deck or fence be pressure washed before staining begins?</h5>
					<p>A: Yes, all surfaces we stain will first be pressure washed in order to remove dirt, mold, and old stain.</p>
					<h5>Q: What types of stain can I choose from?</h5>
					<p>1) Transparent stain: doesn't have much color and shows more of the natural wood.
					<br>
					2) Semi-transparent stain: this is the most common kind and shows some of the wood's grain depending on the stain's  color and shade.
					<br>
					3) Solid stain: shows no wood grain and has a consistency is like paint. </p>
					<h5>Q: My deck currently has a solid stain, can I switch to a transparent or semi-transparent stain?</h5>
					<p>A: Because solid stains don't come off unless sanded, we recommend staying with a solid stain or having us sand your deck first. </p>
					<h5>Q: How long will it take for my deck to dry?</h5>
					<p>A: It should take between 24 and 48 hours for your deck to dry, depending on the weather.</p>

					<p>A: Yes, our blend is all natural and completely safe for humans and animals.</p>
					<h5>Q: Is the application DEET free?</h5>
					<p>A: Yes! Our blend is made out of 100% natural ingredients and is DEET free.</p>
					<h5>Q: Does the application kill bees or butterflies? </h5>

			<h4 class="greentitle">Fertilizer & Herbicide</h4>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="easyreader">
					<h5>Q: What do the numbers mean? Ex. 28-3- 9</h5>
					<p>A: The numbers represent the ratio of each component, out of 100 pounds.
						<br>
					Nitrogen - Phosphorus - Potassium. In the example above, a 100-pound bag of fertilizer would have 28 lbs of nitrogen, 3 lbs of phosphorus, and 9 lbs of potassium. A fertilizer with all three parts is known as a "complete fertilizer." </p>
					<h5>Q: What does UFLEXX do?</h5>
					<p>A: It allows your grass to get the most out of the nitrogen in the fertilizer by 1) protecting the nitrogen from the atmosphere so it doesn’t biodegrade too quickly 2) stabilizes the nitrogen so the plant can absorb and utilize a higher amount of it.</p>
					<h5>Q: What does Iron do?</h5>
					<p>A: Iron is essential for plant respiration. Plant iron deficiencies appear as chlorosis (yellowing) on the youngest (most upper) leaves. Iron enhances turf color without stimulating excessive leaf growth.</p>
					<h5>Q: What are the different kinds of Herbicides?</h5>
					<p>A: The different kinds include:
						<ul class="push">Pre-emergence
						<li class="pushmore">Applied before the weeds sprout through the soil surface.</li>
						<li class="pushmore">Applied when soil temperature (first two inches) reaches 50-52 degrees F. (late April or early May).</li>
						<li class="pushmore">Also, it can be performed in the fall (October) for control of cool-season annual weeds.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="push">Post-emergence
						<li class="pushmore">Applied after weeds have sprouted.</li>
						<li class="pushmore">Most effective when weeds are small (less than 4”).</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<h5>Q: How long do I have to stay off my grass after an application?</h5>
					<p>A: We recommend waiting at least 24-48 hours before walking on chemically treated grass. </p>
